I used to maintain a Wordpress powered blog at [thelimbeck.wordpress.com](https://thelimbeck.wordpress.com) for almost my whole undergraduate life (2011 to 2015). Over these years I noticed my posts getting more fragmented and random-ish. A lot has changed since then, and I have decide to archive the old blog.

I always wanted a very clean, minimalist static site pages blog. So I just decided to reboot the entire site based on Jekyll. The new blog is essentially text based and should be very fast to load. Also this change comes partly from my hidden wish to write more better thought-out, deeper articles and not the one-off, haphazard posts on my old blog.
