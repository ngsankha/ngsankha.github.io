I had been blogging at my [old blog](https://thelimbeck.wordpress.com) on Wordpress for almost the entire length of my undergraduate years (2011 to 2015). A lot has changed since then.

I always wanted a very clean, minimalist text focused static site pages blog. So I just decided to reboot the entire site based on Jekyll. The new blog is essentially text focused and should be very fast to load. Also this change comes partly from my hidden wish to write more better thought-out, deeper articles and not the random-ish posts on my old blog.
