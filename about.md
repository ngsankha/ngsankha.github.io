Hi! I'm Sankha. I am a part of the team of software developers at [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com).

I recently graduated with a Bachelors in Technology in Systems Science from IIT Jodhpur. During my undergraduate years I did a lot of graph theory, mathematics in my courses and some programming in my free time.

I write (mostly) open-source code and used to contribute to Mozilla Firefox. Many of my patches were to SpiderMonkey - the JavaScript engine.

You can contact me at [me@sankhs.com](mailto:me@sankhs.com). I can also be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sankha93) and [GitHub](https://github.com/sankha93).
