Hi! I'm Sankha. I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://cs.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu), advised by [Prof. Jeff Foster](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/).

Previously, I was a part of the team of software developers at [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com). Prior to that, I graduated with my Bachelors degree from [Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in).

I write (mostly) open-source code and used to contribute to Mozilla Firefox. Many of my patches were to SpiderMonkey - the JavaScript engine.
